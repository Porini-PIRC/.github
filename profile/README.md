# Porini Innovation & Research Center (PIRC)

*Porini Innovation & Research Center (PIRC) is where academia meets industry within Porini – driving innovation, cultivating expertise, and turning cutting-edge research into real-world business value.*

**Porini Innovation & Research Center (PIRC)** is the innovation and R\&D division of Porini, focused on advancing data science, AI, and analytics. Founded in early 2021, PIRC’s mission is to facilitate Porini’s growth through continuous learning and **research & innovation** activities that ensure customers benefit from the most advanced solutions available. It serves as an *“incubator of excellence”* within the DGS group – integrating **training, cutting-edge research, and knowledge dissemination** – to enrich talent and drive innovation in emerging technologies.

## Core Objectives & Expertise

### Leading-Edge Data Science & AI
PIRC specializes in fields like advanced analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, constantly exploring new tools (especially Microsoft Azure AI services) to solve complex problems. The team conducts applied R&D to develop innovative data-driven solutions, keeping Porini at the forefront of technology.

### Continuous Learning & Talent Development
A key purpose of PIRC is to foster ongoing education (internal and external). It works closely with Porini’s Education unit to provide training, mentorship, and upskilling opportunities, ensuring consultants and young professionals stay current on the latest data science techniques.

### Academic Collaboration & Knowledge Transfer
PIRC actively bridges academia and industry. By partnering with universities and research institutes, it brings **innovation and knowledge** from academic research into real-world applications. This collaboration accelerates tech transfer, allowing cutting-edge research results to directly inform Porini’s customer solutions.

### Advanced Solutions for Clients
Ultimately, PIRC’s efforts feed into Porini’s offerings. Research prototypes and innovative models developed by the PIRC team are tested and refined so that Porini’s clients can leverage state-of-the-art solutions in AI, data analytics, and digital transformation. This ensures Porini delivers **“the most advanced and innovative solutions available on the market”**.

## Key Initiatives & Collaborations

PIRC leads and supports several high-impact initiatives, often in partnership with universities and research centers, to push the boundaries of data science and innovation:

### LIUC Healthcare Data Science Lab (HD Lab)
Collaboration with the **LIUC Business School**’s Healthcare Data Lab to merge cutting-edge data science with healthcare management research. This partnership focuses on applying advanced analytics and AI to improve healthcare operations and decision-making, bridging academic research outcomes with real-world healthcare solutions. LIUC students also undertake thesis internships at PIRC, working on health data science projects using the latest cloud technologies. 

### University of Padova – Physics of Data
Alliance with the University of Padua’s *Physics of Data* Master’s program, integrating the analytical skills of budding physicists with modern cloud and AI tools. Under this framework, PIRC provides a platform for master’s students and researchers to apply high-performance computing and AI to scientific data problems, combining **curiosity-driven research** with industry-focused applications on Microsoft Azure. This helps train the next generation of data scientists while sparking innovations that benefit both academia and industry.

### LIUC i-FAB (Intelligent Factory) Lab
Partnership with the **i-FAB Laboratory** (an innovative manufacturing lab at LIUC University) to apply AI and data science in smart manufacturing. PIRC and i-FAB jointly explore how AI algorithms and VR/AR can optimize production processes. In this living lab (a simulated production facility), students and PIRC researchers test new Industry 4.0 procedures and measure their impact, then scale successful innovations into real manufacturing contexts. As part of this collaboration, engineering students gain hands-on experience via thesis projects in applied AI for manufacturing at PIRC’s base in the ComoNExT innovation hub.

### University of Milano-Bicocca – Applied Statistics Center
  Ongoing engagement with the Bicocca Applied Statistics Center, focusing on statistical methodologies for big data. This collaboration allows PIRC to work with academic statisticians on advanced analytical techniques and to incorporate statistical research breakthroughs into Porini’s analytics solutions.

### European Big Data Value Association (BDVA)
  PIRC is a member of the **BDVA/DAIRO**, a public-private partnership with the European Commission on Big Data and AI. Through BDVA, PIRC contributes to European-wide initiatives on data innovation and benefits from a network of leading experts in AI and big data. PIRC team members have participated in writing whitepapers (e.g. on AI trustworthiness) and co-leading **working groups on skills & education in AI** within BDVA, ensuring Porini has a voice in shaping the future of data science at the European level.

## Services and Offerings

As an innovation hub, PIRC not only drives internal R&D but also offers resources for experimentation.

### Thought Leadership & Knowledge Sharing
  PIRC frequently organizes or contributes to workshops, seminars, and hackathons (often in collaboration with universities) to disseminate knowledge. Team members have hosted thesis students and published research papers, ensuring that PIRC’s learnings are shared both within Porini and with the broader data science community. By maintaining a blog and a dedicated portal for PIRC initiatives, the team communicates ongoing projects and breakthroughs in an accessible way (so stakeholders and young professionals can stay informed about the latest in data innovation).
